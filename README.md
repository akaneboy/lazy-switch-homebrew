# lazy-switch-homebrew
Pre-made sd card folder for Nintendo Switch homebrewing for the lazies(including me).

I created this folder following the [NH Switch Guide](https://nh-server.github.io/switch-guide/user_guide/emummc/sd_preparation/)

This repo will be updated when a new hekate and/or atmosphere version comes up(obviously).
